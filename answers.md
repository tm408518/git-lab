    Initial commit
Answer 9: On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
Answer 10: No, but I see the problem I believe the first time I tried to commit the Working tree for the updated README it didnt work correctly as it says 'nothing to commit'. I Know what the problem is but am unsure how to fix it
Answer 11: Same error as earlier, but I believe right here it would say push failed, as we have already pushed all committed work right?
Answer 12: Again they should have been updated, What I did is chose to fix it locally by clicking "accept both changes" in visual studio and commiting again and then pushing to update it on github. I then tried to push again (Answer 11:) and now it says everything is up-to-date so I believe I solved the issue
Answer 13: .  ..  .git  .gitignore  README.md

DONE
